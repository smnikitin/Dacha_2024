1/20 VISIT - HAIYAN’S comment
Malden 1
 
Description:
Malden 1 is a newly renovated property with a fresh, strong smell indicative of its recent updates. It offers a spacious 1200 square feet of living area. This house features central heating and boasts a charming wooden deck outside. Uniquely, the living room is situated on the top floor. It's located a bit far from the T station, though the train provides convenient access to downtown. The proximity to the landlord might be a consideration for some tenants.
 
Pros:
1.Brand New Renovation: Ensures a modern and clean living space.
2.Spacious: At 1200 square feet, it offers ample room.
3.Central Heating: Provides comfortable living conditions during colder months.
4.Outdoor Space: The wooden deck offers a nice outdoor area for relaxation.
5.Convenient Train Access: Easy train commute to downtown areas.
 
Cons:
1.Strong Renovation Smell: Might be uncomfortable for some people initially.
2.Distance from T Station: Could be inconvenient for daily commuters.
3.Immediate Availability: The landlord's desire for an ASAP lease start might not align with our timelines.
4.Proximity to Landlord: May not be convenient.
5.Rent: At $3500, it might be on the higher side for its size and location.
